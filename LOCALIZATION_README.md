   - Automatic RTL switching
   - Smooth animations for language transitions

2. **RTL Support**
   - Automatic direction switching (LTR/RTL)
   - CSS adjustments for RTL layout
   - Proper text alignment and spacing

3. **Smooth Animations**
   - Page transitions with framer-motion
   - Language switcher animations
   - Component-level animations

```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Localization Context

The `LocalizationContext` provides:
- Current language state
- Direction (LTR/RTL)
- Language switching functionality
- Persistence in localStorage

### 2. Translation System

The translation system includes:
- Type-safe translations
- Comprehensive translation keys
- Separate files for English and Arabic

### 3. RTL Support

RTL support is implemented through:
- Automatic HTML `dir` attribute switching
- CSS adjustments for RTL layout
- Component-level direction handling

### 4. Animations

Animations are implemented using:
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- Page-level animations
- Component-level animations
- Language switcher animations

## Usage

### Switching Languages

The language switcher is implemented in the header component. Users can toggle between English and Arabic with a smooth animation.

### Adding New Translations

1. Add new keys to the `Translations` interface in `translations.ts`
2. Add translations for both English and Arabic
3. Use the `useTranslation` hook in components

### Using Translations in Components

```typescript
import { useTranslation } from '../../hooks/useTranslation';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const t = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <h1>{t.myTranslationKey}</h1>
  );
}
```

## Components Updated

All components have been updated to support localization:
- Navigation components
- Dashboard components
- Form components
- Modal components
- Table components
- UI components

## Testing

The localization system has been tested with:
- Language switching functionality
- RTL layout adjustments
- Animation smoothness
- Translation accuracy

## Future Improvements

1. Dynamic translation loading
2. Language-specific date formatting
3. Number formatting based on locale
4. Advanced RTL layout adjustments
5. Translation management tools
